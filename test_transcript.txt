Engineering Team Stand-up Meeting - 2025-01-15

Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's kick off today's stand-up. I'll go first. Yesterday I wrapped up the code review for the authentication microservice. We need to refactor some legacy code before we can merge the pull request. I'm going to circle back on that today.

Mike: Thanks Sarah. On my end, I've been working on the API migration. We need to deprecate the old REST endpoints by end of Q1. I reached out to the DevOps team yesterday and they're on board with the deployment plan. Today I'll touch base with the frontend team to make sure we're all on the same page.

Sarah: That makes sense. Did you run into any bottlenecks?

Mike: Not really, but we should keep an eye on the database performance. The new schema might cause some issues at scale.

Lisa: Speaking of performance, I've been doing a deep dive into our monitoring setup. We need to set up proper alerting for the production environment. I'll take a look at the metrics dashboard and see what we can improve.

Sarah: Good call. We should also think about implementing feature flags for the gradual rollout. That way we can play it by ear and roll back if anything goes wrong.

Mike: Agreed. I'll follow up with the product team to get their input on the rollout strategy. We don't want to paint ourselves into a corner here.

Lisa: Before we wrap up, one more thing - we need to schedule a retrospective meeting. There were some pain points during the last sprint that we should address. I'll send out a calendar invite.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's sync up again tomorrow. If any blockers come up, don't hesitate to reach out on Slack.

Mike: Sounds good. I'll keep everyone in the loop on the API migration progress.

Lisa: Thanks everyone. Let's get back to it!
